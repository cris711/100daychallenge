# 100daychallenge
I was turned onto a means to build a skillset called "your own 100 day challenge", in which as the name implies you take on the challenge of improving a skill over the span of 100 days. For myself I decided to improve my python (or java) skillset, so for the 100 day span I have been programming python everyday whether it be a simple program or continuously building upon a more complex program.
